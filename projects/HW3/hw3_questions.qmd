This assignment expores two methods for estimating the MNL model: (1) via Maximum Likelihood, and (2) via a Bayesian approach using a Metropolis-Hastings MCMC algorithm. 


## 1. Likelihood for the Multi-nomial Logit (MNL) Model

Suppose we have $i=1,\ldots,n$ consumers who each select exactly one product $j$ from a set of $J$ products. The outcome variable is the identity of the product chosen $y_i \in \{1, \ldots, J\}$ or equivalently a vector of $J-1$ zeros and $1$ one, where the $1$ indicates the selected product. For example, if the third product was chosen out of 3 products, then either $y=3$ or $y=(0,0,1)$ depending on how we want to represent it. Suppose also that we have a vector of data on each product $x_j$ (eg, brand, price, etc.). 

We model the consumer's decision as the selection of the product that provides the most utility, and we'll specify the utility function as a linear function of the product characteristics:

$$ U_{ij} = x_j'\beta + \epsilon_{ij} $$

where $\epsilon_{ij}$ is an i.i.d. extreme value error term. 

The choice of the i.i.d. extreme value error term leads to a closed-form expression for the probability that consumer $i$ chooses product $j$:

$$ \mathbb{P}_i(j) = \frac{e^{x_j'\beta}}{\sum_{k=1}^Je^{x_k'\beta}} $$

For example, if there are 3 products, the probability that consumer $i$ chooses product 3 is:

$$ \mathbb{P}_i(3) = \frac{e^{x_3'\beta}}{e^{x_1'\beta} + e^{x_2'\beta} + e^{x_3'\beta}} $$

A clever way to write the individual likelihood function for consumer $i$ is the product of the $J$ probabilities, each raised to the power of an indicator variable ($\delta_{ij}$) that indicates the chosen product:

$$ L_i(\beta) = \prod_{j=1}^J \mathbb{P}_i(j)^{\delta_{ij}} = \mathbb{P}_i(1)^{\delta_{i1}} \times \ldots \times \mathbb{P}_i(J)^{\delta_{iJ}}$$

Notice that if the consumer selected product $j=3$, then $\delta_{i3}=1$ while $\delta_{i1}=\delta_{i2}=0$ and the likelihood is:

$$ L_i(\beta) = \mathbb{P}_i(1)^0 \times \mathbb{P}_i(2)^0 \times \mathbb{P}_i(3)^1 = \mathbb{P}_i(3) = \frac{e^{x_3'\beta}}{\sum_{k=1}^3e^{x_k'\beta}} $$

The joint likelihood (across all consumers) is the product of the $n$ individual likelihoods:

$$ L_n(\beta) = \prod_{i=1}^n L_i(\beta) = \prod_{i=1}^n \prod_{j=1}^J \mathbb{P}_i(j)^{\delta_{ij}} $$

And the joint log-likelihood function is:

$$ \ell_n(\beta) = \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^J \delta_{ij} \log(\mathbb{P}_i(j)) $$



## 2. Simulate Conjoint Data

We will simulate data from a conjoint experiment about video content streaming services. We elect to simulate 100 respondents, each completing 10 choice tasks, where they choose from three alternatives per task. For simplicity, there is not a "no choice" option; each simulated respondent must select one of the 3 alternatives. 

Each alternative is a hypothetical streaming offer consistent of three attributes: (1) brand is either Netflix, Amazon Prime, or Hulu; (2) ads can either be part of the experience, or it can be ad-free, and (3) price per month ranges from \$4 to \$32 in increments of \$4.

The part-worths (ie, preference weights or beta parameters) for the attribute levels will be 1.0 for Netflix, 0.5 for Amazon Prime (with 0 for Hulu as the reference brand); -0.8 for included adverstisements (0 for ad-free); and -0.1*price so that utility to consumer $i$ for hypothethical streaming service $j$ is 

$$
u_{ij} = (1 \times Netflix_j) + (0.5 \times Prime_j) + (-0.8*Ads_j) - 0.1\times Price_j + \varepsilon_{ij}
$$

where the variables are binary indicators and $\varepsilon$ is Type 1 Extreme Value (ie, Gumble) distributed.

The following code provides the simulation of the conjoint data.

# set seed for reproducibility
set.seed(123)

# define attributes
brand <- c("N", "P", "H") # Netflix, Prime, Hulu
ad <- c("Yes", "No")
price <- seq(8, 32, by=4)

# generate all possible profiles
profiles <- expand.grid(
    brand = brand,
    ad = ad,
    price = price
)
m <- nrow(profiles)

# assign part-worth utilities (true parameters)
b_util <- c(N = 1.0, P = 0.5, H = 0)
a_util <- c(Yes = -0.8, No = 0.0)
p_util <- function(p) -0.1 * p

# number of respondents, choice tasks, and alternatives per task

    # loop over choice tasks
    for (t in 1:n_tasks) {
        
        # randomly sample 3 alts (better practice would be to use a design)
        dat <- cbind(resp=id, task=t, profiles[sample(m, size=n_alts), ])
        
        # compute deterministic portion of utility
        dat$v <- b_util[dat$brand] + a_util[dat$ad] + p_util(dat$price) |> round(10)
        
        # add Gumbel noise (Type I extreme value)
        dat$e <- -log(-log(runif(n_alts)))
        dat$u <- dat$v + dat$e
        
        # identify chosen alternative
        dat$choice <- as.integer(dat$u == max(dat$u))
        
        # store task
        datlist[[t]] <- dat
    }
    
    # combine all tasks for one respondent
    do.call(rbind, datlist)
}

# simulate data for all respondents
conjoint_data <- do.call(rbind, lapply(1:n_peeps, sim_one))

# remove values unobservable to the researcher
conjoint_data <- conjoint_data[ , c("resp", "task", "brand", "ad", "price", "choice")]

# clean up

## 3. Preparing the Data for Estimation

The "hard part" of the MNL likelihood function is organizing the data, as we need to keep track of 3 dimensions (consumer $i$, covariate $k$, and product $j$) instead of the typical 2 dimensions for cross-sectional regression models (consumer $i$ and covariate $k$). The fact that each task for each respondent has the same number of alternatives (3) helps.  In addition, we need to convert the categorical variables for brand and ads into binary variables.

_todo: reshape and prep the data_
```{python}
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from scipy.optimize import minimize
from numpy.linalg import inv
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```


```{python}
conjoint = pd.read_csv('conjoint_data.csv')
conjoint

conjoint['ad_yes'] = conjoint['ad'].apply(lambda x: 1 if x == 'Yes' else 0)
df_dummies = pd.get_dummies(conjoint, columns=['brand'], drop_first=True)
df_dummies.drop(columns=['ad'], inplace=True)
df_dummies = df_dummies.astype(int)
df_dummies
```


## 4. Estimation via Maximum Likelihood

_todo: Code up the log-likelihood function._

_todo: Use `optim()` in R or `scipy.optimize()` in Python to find the MLEs for the 4 parameters ($\beta_\text{netflix}$, $\beta_\text{prime}$, $\beta_\text{ads}$, $\beta_\text{price}$), as well as their standard errors (from the Hessian). For each parameter construct a 95% confidence interval._
```{python}
def log_likelihood(beta, data, negate=False):
    beta_n, beta_p, beta_ad, beta_price = beta
    utility = (
        beta_n * data["brand_N"] +
        beta_p * data["brand_P"] +
        beta_ad * data["ad_yes"] +
        beta_price * data["price"]
    )
    data = data.copy()
    data["exp_utility"] = np.exp(utility)
    data["denom"] = data.groupby(["resp", "task"])["exp_utility"].transform("sum")
    data["prob"] = data["exp_utility"] / data["denom"]
    data["log_likelihood"] = data["choice"] * np.log(data["prob"])
    result = data["log_likelihood"].sum()
    return -result if negate else result 
```

```{python}
initial_beta = np.zeros(4)
result = minimize(log_likelihood, initial_beta, args=(df_dummies, True), method="BFGS")

# Extract estimates, standard errors, and 95% confidence intervals
beta_hat = result.x
hessian_inv = result.hess_inv
std_errors = np.sqrt(np.diag(hessian_inv))
conf_int = np.vstack([beta_hat - 1.96 * std_errors, beta_hat + 1.96 * std_errors]).T

# Print results
params = ["brand_N", "brand_P", "ad_Yes", "price"]
for i in range(4):
    print(f"{params[i]}: Estimate = {beta_hat[i]:.4f}, StdErr = {std_errors[i]:.4f}, "
          f"95% CI = [{conf_int[i, 0]:.4f}, {conf_int[i, 1]:.4f}]")
```


## 5. Estimation via Bayesian Methods

_todo: code up a metropolis-hasting MCMC sampler of the posterior distribution. Take 11,000 steps and throw away the first 1,000, retaining the subsequent 10,000._

_hint: Use N(0,5) priors for the betas on the binary variables, and a N(0,1) prior for the price beta._

_hint: instead of calculating post=lik*prior, you can work in the log-space and calculate log-post = log-lik + log-prior (this should enable you to re-use your log-likelihood function from the MLE section just above)_

_hint: King Markov (in the video) use a candidate distribution of a coin flip to decide whether to move left or right among his islands.  Unlike King Markov, we have 4 dimensions (because we have 4 betas) and our dimensions are continuous.  So, use a multivariate normal distribution to pospose the next location for the algorithm to move to. I recommend a MNV(mu, Sigma) where mu=c(0,0,0,0) and sigma has diagonal values c(0.05, 0.05, 0.05, 0.005) and zeros on the off-diagonal.  Since this MVN has no covariances, you can sample each dimension independently (so 4 univariate normals instead of 1 multivariate normal), where the first 3 univariate normals are N(0,0.05) and the last one if N(0,0.005)._


_todo: for at least one of the 4 parameters, show the trace plot of the algorithm, as well as the histogram of the posterior distribution._

_todo: report the 4 posterior means, standard deviations, and 95% credible intervals and compare them to your results from the Maximum Likelihood approach._

```{python}
# Define log-prior
def log_prior(beta):
    # N(0,5) for first 3; N(0,1) for price
    log_p = -0.5 * ((beta[0:3]**2) / 5 + (beta[3]**2) / 1)
    return np.sum(log_p)

# Define log-posterior
def log_posterior(beta, data, negate=False):
    return log_likelihood(beta, data, negate=False) + log_prior(beta)
```

```{python}
# Run MCMC using Metropolis-Hastings
np.random.seed(0)
n_iter = 11000
burn_in = 1000
beta_samples = np.zeros((n_iter, 4))
beta_current = np.zeros(4)
log_post_current = log_posterior(beta_current, df_dummies, negate=True)
proposal_std = np.array([0.05, 0.05, 0.05, 0.005])

for i in range(n_iter):
    proposal = beta_current + np.random.normal(0, proposal_std)
    log_post_proposal = log_posterior(proposal, df_dummies, negate=True)
    log_accept_ratio = log_post_proposal - log_post_current
    if np.log(np.random.rand()) < log_accept_ratio:
        beta_current = proposal
        log_post_current = log_post_proposal
    beta_samples[i] = beta_current
```

```{python}
# Discard burn-in
posterior_samples = beta_samples[burn_in:]

# Compute summary statistics
posterior_means = posterior_samples.mean(axis=0)
posterior_sds = posterior_samples.std(axis=0)
posterior_cis = np.percentile(posterior_samples, [2.5, 97.5], axis=0).T

params = ["brand_N", "brand_P", "ad_Yes", "price"]
print("Posterior Summary:")
for i in range(4):
    print(f"{params[i]}: Mean = {posterior_means[i]:.4f}, SD = {posterior_sds[i]:.4f}, "
          f"95% CI = [{posterior_cis[i, 0]:.4f}, {posterior_cis[i, 1]:.4f}]")
```

```
## 6. Discussion

_todo: Suppose you did not simulate the data. What do you observe about the parameter estimates? What does $\beta_\text{Netflix} > \beta_\text{Prime}$ mean? Does it make sense that $\beta_\text{price}$ is negative?_

_todo: At a high level, discuss what change you would need to make in order to simulate data from --- and estimate the parameters of --- a multi-level (aka random-parameter or hierarchical) model. This is the model we use to analyze "real world" conjoint data._


The parameter estimates from both the maximum likelihood and Bayesian approaches align well with intuition about consumer behavior. The positive coefficients for brand_N and brand_P indicate that, on average, consumers prefer these brands over the baseline brand H, with a stronger preference for brand_N (Netflix) over brand_P (Prime Video). This suggests a clear brand hierarchy in perceived utility.  

The negative coefficient on price is both expected and meaningful. It implies that, holding other factors constant, an increase in price decreases the probability that a product is chosen. This is consistent with standard economic theory: consumers are price-sensitive and prefer cheaper options, all else being equal. The fact that \beta_{\text{price}} < 0 supports the validity of the model.  

Interestingly, the ad_Yes coefficient is also negative, suggesting that the presence of advertising reduces utility. In this context, it may be that ads are perceived as intrusive or associated with lower-value offerings, leading to a lower probability of choice for advertised options.  

To extend the model and better reflect real-world variation in consumer preferences, one could use a multilevel (hierarchical) model. In such models, individual-level parameters \beta_i are assumed to vary across respondents and are drawn from a population distribution (e.g., \beta_i \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu, \Sigma)). This captures heterogeneity by allowing each respondent to weigh attributes differently. Estimation involves recovering both individual preferences and the population-level parameters, typically via hierarchical Bayes or simulated maximum likelihood. This approach is widely used in practical conjoint analysis for more accurate prediction and segmentation.
